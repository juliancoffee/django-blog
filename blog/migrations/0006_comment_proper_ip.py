    # ORM should properly convert all the types, yes? yes?

    # NOTE: The obvious disadvantage is that its all done outside of database,
    # which isn't a big problem if we have two rows, but yeah, that's still
    # *highly* inefficient, because we need to move all the data over the wire
    # and into the application memory.

    # Not so obvious disadvantage of doing it this way is that, well, if you
    # forget to call .save(), your migration pretty much didn't run at all.
